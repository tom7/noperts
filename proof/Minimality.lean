# Every nopert has at least 7 points

A convex polyhedron is *Rupert* if a copy of it can pass through a straight
hole cut in another copy of the same size (`IsRupert`, `MainTheorem.lean`:
some view of the polyhedron, possibly shifted, fits strictly inside the
shadow of another view).  A *nopert* is a solid convex polyhedron that is not
Rupert (`IsNopert`, `Nopert.lean`).  Polyhedra are given by finite sets
`V : Finset ℝ³` of points; the polyhedron is their convex hull.

This file states the main results; the proofs are in the `Minimality/`
modules (see `Minimality/README.md` for an overview).

* `seven_le_card_of_isNopert`: every nopert has at least 7 points.  This
  follows from `isRupert_of_card_le_six`: every solid convex polyhedron
  given by at most 6 points is Rupert.
* `facet_card_le_four_of_isNopert`: a nopert with exactly 7 points has no
  facet containing 5 or more of them, so its faces are triangles and
  quadrilaterals.  This follows from `isRupert_of_card_seven_of_facet`: seven
  points with a solid hull, at least five (but not all) of them on a facet, are
  Rupert (Theorem A of the notes; `Minimality/FaceFive.lean`).
* For flat point sets the answer is known for any number of points: points in
  a plane, not all on one line, are Rupert
  (`isRupert_of_coplanar_of_not_collinear`), while points on one line are not
  (`not_isRupert_of_collinear`).  Hence `isRupert_iff_of_card_le_six`:
  at most 6 points are Rupert exactly when they are not all on one line (or
  there are none at all).

All results depend only on the three standard axioms `propext`,
`Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

/-- **Every solid convex polyhedron with at most 6 vertices is Rupert.**
More precisely: at most 6 points of `ℝ³`, not all in one plane, have a Rupert
convex hull.  (The points need not all be vertices of the hull.) -/

all in one plane, of which at least five but not all lie on a facet of their
convex hull, are Rupert.  (`Minimality.IsFacet V F`: some affine function
vanishes on `F` and is negative at the other points of `V`.) -/

faces** (Theorem B of the notes: four quadrilateral facets force the face
structure called type 02, which is Rupert by a slightly tilted view along the
edge where two of the quadrilaterals meet). General position
(`Minimality.GenPos`): no two segments between the points are parallel or
orthogonal. The special positions are proved on paper (FEWER-FACES-PROOFS.md
§4) except several simultaneous depth ties, and not yet formalized. -/

/-- **No two quadrilateral facets sharing one vertex** (Corollary T1 of the
triangle-shadow lemma, `FEWER-FACES-PROOFS.md` §7; types 02, 07, 09, 14, 18, 20):
a 7-point nopert in general position has no two quadrilateral facets meeting in a
single vertex, given general position at the line of their planes
(`Minimality.TriGen`: no segment parallel to it, distinct depths along it). -/

position, two facets meeting in a single vertex `v`, with general position at
the line of their planes (`Minimality.TriGen`), never have every other point
strictly inside the shadow triangle of `v` and two further points `xa`, `xb` of
the facets.  The interior condition is barycentric, stated with any facet
functionals `f1`, `f2` (it does not depend on their scaling). -/
