# Every nopert has at least 7 points

A convex polyhedron is *Rupert* if a copy of it can pass through a straight
hole cut in another copy of the same size (`IsRupert`, `MainTheorem.lean`:
some view of the polyhedron, possibly shifted, fits strictly inside the
shadow of another view).  A *nopert* is a solid convex polyhedron that is not
Rupert (`IsNopert`, `Nopert.lean`).  Polyhedra are given by finite sets
`V : Finset ℝ³` of points; the polyhedron is their convex hull.

This file states the main results; the proofs are in the `Minimality/`
modules (see `Minimality/README.md` for an overview).

* `seven_le_card_of_isNopert`: every nopert has at least 7 points.  This
  follows from `isRupert_of_card_le_six`: every solid convex polyhedron
  given by at most 6 points is Rupert.
* For flat point sets the answer is known for any number of points: points in
  a plane, not all on one line, are Rupert
  (`isRupert_of_coplanar_of_not_collinear`), while points on one line are not
  (`not_isRupert_of_collinear`).  Hence `isRupert_iff_of_card_le_six`:
  at most 6 points are Rupert exactly when they are not all on one line (or
  there are none at all).

All results depend only on the three standard axioms `propext`,
`Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound`.

/-- **Every solid convex polyhedron with at most 6 vertices is Rupert.**
More precisely: at most 6 points of `ℝ³`, not all in one plane, have a Rupert
convex hull.  (The points need not all be vertices of the hull.) -/
