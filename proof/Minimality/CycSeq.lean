# Sequences for the force-polygon argument (LEMMAS.md Theorem 7.3, Steps 1–4)

Pure statements about finite real and planar sequences, indexed by `ℕ`
(only indices `< m` matter):
* `SSlin x m`: the sign pattern of `x` on `[0, m)` is a cyclic arc of `≥ 0`
  values and the complementary arc of `≤ 0` values (one sign switch each way).
* `sign_lemma`: the partial sums of such a sequence, measured from the
  midpoint of the first edge, have strict opposite signs on the two arcs
  between the midpoints of edges `0` and `T` (Step 4(i)).
* `abel_identity`: summation by parts (Step 2).
* `deg_lemma`: the degenerate case where the separating line contains an edge
  (Step 4(ii)).
* `forces_parallel`: Steps 2–4: forces with zero sum and zero depth moment,
  at depths rising from `0` to `T` and falling back, with the sign-switch
  properties of an angularly sorted sequence, are all parallel.

/-- **Theorem 7.3, Steps 2–4.**  Forces `g 0, …, g (m-1)` (the corner forces in
cyclic order, starting at the deepest corner `0` carrying a force; forces may
vanish) with zero sum and zero depth moment, whose depths along the nonzero
forces rise strictly from `0` to `T` and fall strictly back, and whose
directions have the sign-switch properties of an angularly sorted sequence
(`hSS`, and the orientation at the extreme forces `hOr0`, `hOrT`), are all
parallel. -/
