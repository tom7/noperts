# Every polyhedron with at most six vertices is Rupert (LEMMAS.md L10)

After a 2+4 split (Lemma 10.1) with positive points `D, E` and the other four
`W = {P, Q, R, S}`:
* if `W` is coplanar, the segment `DE` crosses `relint conv W` (Lemma 10.3,
  `isRupert_split_coplanar`);
* otherwise `D, E` have barycentric coordinates `β = l`, `γ = m` on `W`
  (`NF`), every point of `W` falls in one of the classes
  `I = (+,-)`, `I½ = (+,0)`, `II = (+,+)`, `II½ = (0,+)`, `III = (-,+)`, and the
  case table of Theorem 10.4 gives an octahedron, a bicapped tetrahedron, a
  T4, a T5 or a T3, each with its facets read off from Gale signs.

`isRupert_of_card_le_six` assembles L5–L10.
